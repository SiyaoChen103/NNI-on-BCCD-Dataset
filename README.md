# NNI-on-BCCD-Dataset
Neural Network Intelligence on Blood Cell Images Classification.
We learned to apply NNI on the BCCD dataset and use neural architecture serach to find an optimal neural network for classificatio the images into 4 blood cell types.
We also trained other neural network on the dataset in order to compare their performances with the optimal model picked by NNI.

## Data Preparation
We downloaded the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells

## Environment setup
```
!pip install nni
!pip install pytorch_lightning
```

## NNI implementation
